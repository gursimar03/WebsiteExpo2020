This marks the post-mobile government phase which will rely on various future services, sectors and infrastructure projects. The strategy is first of its kind in the region and the world and it aims to:

                <h1>Ireland In Dubai EXPO 2020</h1>
                <img class="LeftImage"  src="Images/IrelandExpo.jpg" alt=""/>

                Ireland has been a source of creativity and innovation for 5,000 years and is known as the "Island of Inspiration."

                The subject for Ireland is based on our history and culture, but it also addresses a critical challenge for humanity in the coming age of artificial intelligence and robotics. Empathy, human connection, and community are all enhanced through creativity. Non-confrontational responses to diversity are facilitated through creative expression, which also serves as a forum for addressing complicated personal and societal issues.

                This is the point we're making at Expo Dubai: the importance of putting creativity at the center of the 21st century human experience.
                Our topic is in line with Expo 2020's general theme of "Connecting Minds, Creating the Future." Over the six months of Expo programming, our goal is to bring this idea into debate and discussion, and to position the topic of human creativity in terms of humanity's future well-being.

                <h1>Main Focus : Team Ireland </h1>

                Government Departments and State Agencies work collaboratively with other Irish Stakeholders to boost our international reputation and drive the development of trade, tourism, investment, science, technology, and innovation, culture, and education through a Team Ireland strategy. Every day, Team Ireland overseas, with the help of support teams at home, works to find and seize new opportunities for Ireland.
